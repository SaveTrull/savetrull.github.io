                <p><strong>Somerset Wildlife Trust</strong> has raised <strong>serious concerns</strong> about the ecological impact of the proposed development:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>The Trust warns it may <strong>object</strong> if key documents (such as biodiversity and construction plans) are not provided or made conditions of planning.</li>
                    <li>They stress that green spaces must <strong>support wildlife</strong>, not just recreation — calling for denser hedgerows, wildlife corridors, and improved drainage to aid biodiversity.</li>
                    <li>They note this site is <strong>not allocated in the Local Plan</strong>, giving the Council more flexibility to prioritise environmental protection.</li>

                <p class="mb-0">The Trust’s current stance is <strong>conditional</strong>, and failure to meet ecological standards could result in an official objection.</p>

            </div>
            <p>It has been proposed that a field within Trull, that is green wedge land is going to have 125+ houses built
                on it. This is in addition to the development of 2000 houses being built between Trull and Rumwell, and so
                there is great concern that this development within the village will put even greater strain on Trull
                itself. See the reasons below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Overwhelming local resources</b><br/>
                    The development does not provide new schools or medical facilities. This means the current services,
                    already under strain, will be overwhelmed by the influx of new residents, negatively impacting existing
                    residents.
                </li>
                <li><b>Loss of village status</b><br/>This development threatens Trull's village status by creating a direct
                    road linking Trull to Galmington and dramatically altering its character, turning the area into a more
                    urbanized environment. This loss of separation between Trull and its neighboring areas is a serious risk
                    to the village’s unique identity.
                </li>
                <li><b>Increase in traffic</b><br/>There will be a substantial increase in local traffic and congestion.
                </li>
                <li><b>Destruction of Green Wedge</b><br/>The field is part of the Green Wedge, which protects Trull from
                    urban sprawl and supports wildlife. Deer, hedgehogs and foxes are frequently spotted in this
                    field.
                </li>
                <li><b>Environmental Impact</b><br/>The field is Grade 2 agricultural land, which provides a healthy
                    environment for wildlife and helps protect the rural character of Trull. This land is vital for local
                    biodiversity but would be lost to housing.
                </li>

                <p>Save Trull is a community initiative aimed at preserving the unique character and environment of our
                    village. The proposed development of 125 new houses on Comeytrowe Road threatens to significantly impact
                    our community. As residents, it's crucial we understand these potential changes and take action to

                <h3>Key Concerns</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Loss of Green Wedge:</strong> This development will encroach on the Green Wedge, which
                        currently acts as a buffer to protect Trull’s rural identity. The destruction of open farmland and
                        habitats is a major concern for the local wildlife and the village's character.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Impact:</strong> The visual impact on Trull will be dramatic, as outlined in the
                        planning documents. The rural landscape will be replaced with rows of houses, drastically changing
                        the village’s appearance.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Traffic:</strong> With more than 125 homes, the development will add significant
                        traffic to Comeytrowe Road and surrounding areas, contributing to congestion and making the village
                        less safe for pedestrians and cyclists.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Noise and Air Pollution:</strong> The Noise Assessment acknowledges the potential for
                        increased noise from traffic. Alongside this, the Air Quality Report highlights the risk of
                        increased pollution from cars, further degrading the quality of life for Trull residents.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Strain on Local Resources:</strong> The development does not provide new schools or
                        medical facilities. This means the current services, already under strain, will be overwhelmed by
                        the influx of new residents, negatively impacting existing residents.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Flood Risk Concerns:</strong> Although the site is designated as Flood Zone 1, the proposed
                        SuDS drainage system may not fully prevent surface water issues, especially during heavy rain,
                        increasing the risk of local flooding.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Threat to Village Status:</strong> One of the most significant concerns is the risk that
                        Trull will lose its identity as a village. The proposed development would create a direct link
                        between Trull and Galmington, leading to urban sprawl. This would erode the unique rural character
                        of Trull, making it feel like an extension of the neighbouring urban areas, rather than a distinct
                        village.
